# Socket Boilerplate

This is a jumping off point for making a little app with socket communication.

**Can be used** for p5.js projects too

## Installation

You need to install both express and socket.io. It should go without saying that this is a node.js project, so you need to have node.js installed on your machine too.

```
npm install express socket.io
```

## Usage

Do your 'frontend work' in the `/static/` folder, the set up should be familiar to basic web development (included downloaded p5.js files)

To run the server do `node index.js`
